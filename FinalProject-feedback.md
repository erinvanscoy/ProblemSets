# PSYC 5P02- Introduction to Programming for Psychology

### Fall 2025
### Final Project Evaluation


#### Overall grade: 88%

---
#### Coding style/Clarity:
* Code is mostly clean, no noticeable errors
:memo: **check/check+** 

#### Coding efficiency:
* Code is efficient but not overly sophisticated
:memo: **check**

#### Documentation:
* I appreciated the extra documentation and readme file
:memo: **check+**

#### Complexity, scale of tasks/analysis, and mastery:
* Fairly basic. Did incorporate videos and a few small novel things, but fairly limited in scope
 :memo: **check-/check**

#### Completeness:
* * No friction. Only critique is it would be easier to access as a stand-alone repository, although was difficult to accomplish given the large video sizes. I wonder if you could have somehow played the videos directly from a hosted location on the web?
