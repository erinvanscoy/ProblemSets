    "## Key Differences between MatLab and Python \n",
    "1. Python\n",
    "   - Treats everything as an object\n",
    "   - Uses 0-based indexing\n",
    "   - Uses indentation to define code blocks\n",
    "   - uses the # symbol for single-line comments\n",
    "2. Matlab\n",
    "   - Treats everything as an array\n",
    "   - Uses 1-based indexing\n",
    "   - Uses the end keyword to terminate blocks of code (e.g., if end)\n",
    "   - Uses the % symbole for single-line comments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables \n",
    "### Vectors and matrices \n",
    "- Vector: Contains muilip[le values/elements within 1-dimension\n",
    "- Matrix: Contains muiliple values/elements within n-dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Vectors \n",
    "- vectors and matrices (arrays) are contained within square brackets : []\n",
    "- e.g., A = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "- Note you dont need commands, but can be useful to seperate datapoints with them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making varibles \n",
    "- The new variables should appear in your workspace\n",
    "- Workspace tells you information about the varible (value, class etc)\n",
    "- You can manually change this information about the variables by right clicking the menu\n",
    "- Another way to see varibles in your workspace is by using the WHO command (who command will list all the variables, while the whos command will also include class information, size etc)\n",
    "- clear command will remove all varibles from the workspace\n",
    "- clear varname1 varname2 will remove the varibles named varname1, and varname2 ONLY\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors \n",
    "- Create a vector along the row dimension using semicolon (;) in place of the commas (,)\n",
    "- E.g., b = [1;2;3;4;5] - produces a 5x1 vector instead of a 1x5 vectore\n",
    "- Note - MatLab uses a ROW x COLUMN structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix \n",
    "- Combining these two dimensions means we can create a matrix of size m *n\n",
    "- c = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6] will look like\n",
    "- c = 1 2\n",
    "      3 4\n",
    "      5 6\n",
    "Each pair is data in a column the ; is a new row\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix CT \n",
    "- Matrices must be rectangular (must contaun same number of elements in each row/column)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indexing Vectors and Matrices \n",
    "- Easily find the value of items in vecxtors and matricies by indexing its position\n",
    "- Round brackets () - used after the varible name , are organized in r * c, seperated by commans\n",
    "- e.g., A = [1 2 3 4 5] and C = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6]\n",
    "- Then: A(5) = 5 and C(2,1) = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors and Matrices \n",
    "- Specify muiliple values by providng a vector\n",
    "- e.g., C([1 3], 1) ans = 1 5\n",
    "- The vector can be its own varible\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Colon (:)\n",
    "- Useful for both setting and looking up values of a matrix\n",
    "- Can be used in three ways:\n",
    "  1. By itself - specify all the elements of a vector or matrix (C(1,:) = 1 2\n",
    "  2. Between two numbers: specify every number form first to last D = 1:10 = D = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n",
    "  3. Between three numbers: middle number specifies the step between the first and last numbers E = 1:2:10 = E = 1 3 5 7 9\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other useful stuff \n",
    "- End command - can specificy the last element of a vector\n",
    "- Size () command - will return the length or size of a varible\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Transpose \n",
    "- Useful but dangerous characters is the single quotation (')\n",
    "- The ' will transpose or flip your matrix along the r*c dimensions\n",
    "- Particularly useful when some variables are imported or defined along wrong dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Varibles \n",
    "- Combine varibles into larger matrices (or vectors) by concatenating them\n",
    "- Simple to do: treat them like numbers and  put them inside a matrx\n",
    "- e.g., A = 1:5, B = 6:10, C = [A B], D = [A;B]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concatenating Matrices \n",
    "- Resulting matrix must always be square\n",
    "- (must have same number of elements in each row/column)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reshaping matrices \n",
    "- Can add elements to the end of a matrix\n",
    "- e..g, A = 1:5, A(6) = 6;\n",
    "- Should only do this when adding to the end of the matrix\n",
    "- Can do manually but inefficient can use the reshape command\n",
    "- e.g., reshape(X, [M,N])\n",
    "- Fills in the matrix moving down rows first\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting items \n",
    "- A = 1:10; - A(5)=[]; (deletes item 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-Allocating Matrices \n",
    "- Pre-allocate your matrix - faster, fewer memory demands. Prvenets needs to flip and reshape , prevents errors\n",
    "- Can fill it with zeros or ones: A = zeroes(3,2);, B = ones(2,3);\n",
    "- Empty with []\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving and loading varibles \n",
    "- Save variables into the Mat-file type using the save command\n",
    "- Can load the MAT-files that contain varibles using the load command\n",
    "- Should have two varibles in your workspace, A and mystring\n",
    "- Type save ('firstmatfile'); and then clear;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving and loading varibles \n",
    "- Can confirm you have nothering in your workspace by typing who\n",
    "- Can load the variables back into the workspace by doing load('firstmatfile') who;\n",
    "- Can also save and load speciifc varibles: by save ('varA', 'A'), clear;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nan vs Empty Values \n",
    "- Create an empty variable using: []\n",
    "- e.g., emptyvar = [];\n",
    "- Nan actually has a size, it stands for Not a number. - Useful for missing values in data sets\n",
    "- e.g., B = Nan; whos\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Operations \n",
    "- Many operations you can perform on single values you can perform on entire arrays/matrices\n",
    "- Can also do things like adding together two matrices of the same size\n",
    "- e.g.,  E = a + b;\n",
    "- Muiltiplcation, division, exponents work according to matrix algebra\n",
    "- e.g., the dot product\n",
    "- For simple operations you unlikeley want to do a matrix algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Calculations \n",
    "- Can do calculatiosn within matrices as well (sum, mean, median, std, var, min, max)\n",
    "- When given an r*c matrix, performs it row by row\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other useful functions \n",
    "- rem (x,y) - gives remainder of x/y\n",
    "- mod(x,y) - similar to rem\n",
    "- Rand(x) produces x*x uniform random values between 0:1\n",
    "- rand(m,n) produces m*n random values\n",
    "- randi(nmax,m,n): prodcues m*n random integers between 1 and nmax\n",
    "- randn(m,n): produce m*n normally distributed random values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other useful functions ct \n",
    "- Specify numbers in a random order\n",
    "- Two ways : randperm(x) - matrix of 1:x numbers in a random order; perms([]) - produce every possible combination of the valyes contained in the matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imaginary Numbers \n",
    "- Special notation - represent a point in a plane with one complex number (one real, one imaginary) \n",
