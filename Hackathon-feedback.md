###  Feedback:

**Q1:**
* **code**: 0/3, **documentation** 0/3

**Q2:**
* Good start. Your issue was you were appending to the same variable that you were using to loop, so you kept making your list longer and longer and it was looping indefinitely. 
* **code**: 2/5, **documentation** 5/5

**Q3:**
* Good start. 
* **code**: 3/5, **documentation** 5/5

**Q4:**

* **code**: 0/5, **documentation** 0/5

**Q5**
* Good. Be sure when you're writing stuff to the terminal you try to be clear about what it is you're writing. 
* **code**: 5/5, **documentation** 4/5

**Q6**
* Good start. The task crashes. You've also put everything in a loop that I don't think has any chance to end. Maybe some confusion about how to best check for responses as well. 
* **code**: 2/4, **documentation** 4/4

:memo: **Total:** 30/54
* I'm only going to grade it out of Qs 1 - 3 , 5 and 6. = 30/44
* I wonder if we should have a chat about getting you a little more up to speed?
